# gowiki

This is code written in the process of learning Go, so do not rely on it for
examples: it is probably full of bad practices and bugs.

* The initial commit comes straight from http://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki
* Later commits are mine (FGM)

See LICENSE.md for the BSD 3-clause license applied to this code, which applies
to both the initial "Go authors" code and the code in later commits.
